1. Make a folder named tessdata. 

2. Download tesseract data at https://github.com/Shreeshrii/tessdata_shreetest/blob/master/digits_comma.traineddata

3. Then put it into that folder.

Note:
```
- Basically I just applied binary threshold to get the numbers then used tesseract (numbers only model)
- Resizing image with high dpi is important step
```
